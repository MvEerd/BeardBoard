## BeardBoard
A row staggered board created with the KLE import function in ergogen  

⚠️ This keyboard is a work in progress and has not been tested yet  
⚠️ Not a great example of a proper Ergogen config


The PCB can be regenerated from the ergogen config files using;
```bash
npm install && npm run gen
```
